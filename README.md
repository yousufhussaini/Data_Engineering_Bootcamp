üöÄ EcZachly Inc. Boot Camp V3 Homework Guidelines
==============================

Welcome to the Bootcamp3 Homework Template Repo! This repository serves as the central hub for organizing and submitting your weekly assignments in our boot camp.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Copy the Repository Template:
- To initiate your homework repository, click the "Use this template" button. 
- Adjust the owner to your personal GitHub account and update the repository name to include your Discord username. 
- Opt for the "Private" option to create a private repository on your GitHub account.

### Step 2. Add TA/GAs to Your Private Repo:
- Add all TA/GA members in the GitHub [TA/GA Team](https://github.com/orgs/DataEngineer-io/teams/ta-gas) as Collaborators in the private homework repo you just created on your GitHub account. To do this, go to Settings &rarr; Access &rarr; Collaborators &rarr; Manage Access. 
- Note: You can also find Teams by going to the [DataEngineer.io Organization Home page](https://github.com/DataEngineer-io) and then visiting the Teams tab. 

### Step 3. Complete Assignments Based on Your Track:
- Navigate to your track's folder: `all_tracks`, `infrastructure`, or `analytics`.
   - **all_tracks:** Contains assignments that everyone needs to complete, e.g., for the data modeling weeks.
   - **infrastructure:** Homework assignments for the infrastructure track.
   - **analytics:** Homework assignments for the analytics track.
- Complete the assignments corresponding to the material covered that week.

   >
   > :bulb: The combined track encompasses all three folders.

### Step 4. Submit Your Assignment via Pull Request (PR) for Review:
- **Separate PRs for Each Assignment:**
   - Please open a new, separate PR for each homework assignment. Even though the template contains multiple assignments within the same repository, each assignment needs to have a separate PR that the TAs/GAs can review.
   - **The branch associated with the PR should only contain changes related to the specific assignment you are submitting.** This is crucial to keep changes focused and make reviews more manageable.
- **Code Quality Matters:**
   - Before opening a PR, ensure your code is complete, adheres to production standards, and runs without commented-out lines or non-functional code.
- **Craft a Thoughtful PR:**
   - When creating your PR, provide a detailed description. Explain the assignment's goal and your approach as if you were introducing an independent project to someone unfamiliar with the task.
- **Tagging for Review:**
   - Only after finalizing your code and adding a comprehensive PR description, tag all TA/GAs in a comment on the PR (specific to **one** assignment) for review.

>
> ‚≠ê **IMPORTANT:** We prioritize providing feedback for fully completed assignments. Please be considerate of the TA/GAs' time and refrain from requesting reviews for work-in-progress submissions. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated.

## üí° **Additional Information**

- **Collaboration:**
   - Choose to work on the homework individually or collaboratively with your camp-mates. 
   - If working with others, it's crucial that **each group member mentions their collaborators (tags or `@`s their GitHub username) in their README** (both parties need to mention each other). This is a preventive measure to identify and address any potential plagiarism.
- **Deadlines:**
	- Homework is typically due at 11:59PM PT on Fridays two weeks after the material is covered. Some deadlines have been extended due to the holiday season.
     - Please check the [schedule](https://dataengineer.io/bootcamp?mode=schedule) for exact dates. These deadlines are final and non-flexible.
   - Revisions are allowed until the deadline, but you should NOT open a PR and tag the TAs/GAs until you have a polished version of the code and descriptive PR. 
- **‚òï Exclusive Coffee Chats:**
   - To participate in the "Coffee Chat with Zach" on Thursdays, homework must be submitted an hour before the Thursday session begins. 
   - You will need to complete the homework due that specific week, not the homework from the previous week. (Yes, this means we're asking for an **early** submission to qualify for the exclusive sessions with Zach.)

### üö® Important Reminders:
   - **DO NOT push your homework solutions or open a PR in the GitHub organization.**
   - **DO NOT create a new repo in the GitHub organization.**
   - A dedicated portal for submitting your homework link is under construction. For now, tag TAs/GAs in the PR on your personal GitHub repo.

### ü§ù Support and Feedback:
   If you have questions or encounter issues, please feel free to reach out to our staff or the TA/GA team on Discord.

### Happy coding!
